# Market-Basket-Analysis-using-Apriori

Market Basket Analysis (MBA) deals with the probability of items bought together in a transaction based on training with previous transaction.

It can be useful for making high critical decisions in the any commercial fields especially E-Commerce, to increase their inbound sales.  

In this problem, I have used to apriori algorithm in R using ARules package to perform MBA using commercial products data represented with SKU_ID

Two results can be obtained - One is based on Support value and other one is based on confidence value. I have listed out the results for both in CSV Format

Thank you
